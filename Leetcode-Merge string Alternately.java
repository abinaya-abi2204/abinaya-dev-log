Merge Strings Alternately
  Given two strings word1 and word2, merge them by alternating characters starting from word1.
If one string is longer, append the remaining characters at the end.

  Example:
Input:  word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Input:  word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"

  Approach:
Use two pointers (or indices) for both strings.
Loop until you reach the end of both strings.
Add characters alternately:
Add from word1 if available
Add from word2 if available
Continue until both are fully traversed.
  
LEETCODE NO 1768:
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string. Return the merged string.
  
Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
  
Example 2:
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
  
Example 3:
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d

Constraints:
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

Complexity:
Time: O(n + m)
Space: O(n + m)

  Java Solution:
class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
            if (i < word1.length()) {
                result.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            }
            if (j < word2.length()) {
                result.append(word2.charAt(j++));
            }
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
